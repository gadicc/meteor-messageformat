		<p><i>NB: this is still a preview release.  Some things marked as TODO aren't implemented yet.</i></p>

		<p><b>MessageFormat for Meteor</b> seamlessly adds support for complicated strings
		(multiple gender, plural, offset, in any permutation) to your project, and
		facilitates the translation of these strings to multiple languages.  All in
		a way you'd expect from a Meteor package.</p>

		<p>{{#markdown}}The package provides both a JavaScript `mf()` function, and
		Handlebars `{{dstache}}mf}}` and `{{dstache}}#mf}}` helpers to be used in templates.  The
		latter are automatically reactive, and will rerender themselves when any
		of the variables used are changed by a reactive computation (e.g. string,
		gender, count, or language).{{/markdown}}</p>

		<p>The package builds on <a href="https://github.com/SlexAxton/messageformat.js/"
		>MessageFormat.js by Alex Sexton</a>.  You should read that page for a good 
		explanation of how MessageFormat works and why it's a better option than <i>gettext</i>, or simply browse the <a href="/examples">examples</a> page to see the different
		combinations possible and how they rerender themselves reactively, with no
		additional work on your part.</p>

<a name="features"></a>
## Features

* [Reactive](/examples) (strings will update themselves when variables or language changes)
* Supports MessageFormat selectformat (e.g. for gender), plural and offset extensions
* [Full translation Web UI](/translate), no need to redeploy your app as new translations arrive
* Language data can be sent on [initial page load](#loadtime), or on demand when
required (a reactive `ready()` method is supplied for [good UI](#rendering)).

<a name="quickstart"></a>
## Quick Start

Meteor MessageFormat can be installed with
[Meteorite](https://github.com/oortcloud/meteorite/). From inside a Meteorite-managed app:

```bash
$ mrt add messageformat
```

In your project, add (in your lib/config.js or other file for both server+client)

```js
mfPkg.init('en');
```

replacing 'en' with the native language of your project, if appropriate.  Additionally,
a second argument can be given, see all possible [options](#options) below.

Now, you just have to use the `{{dstache}}mf}}` helper to mark your strings as translatable, e.g.

```html
<p>This string is translatable</p>
```

becomes

```html
<p>{{dstache}}mf 'trans_string' 'This string is translatable'}}</p>
```

Note that each string needs to be given a unique key ([why?](#whyusekeys)).  There is also an `{{dstache}}#mf}}` [block helper](#templates) for larger strings, and `mf()`
[Javascript function](#javascript).  To extract your strings, run (in your project dir):

```html
sudo npm install -g meteor-messageformat
mf_extract
```

Note:  Since v0.0.13, you shouldn't need to reinstall the npm package
again. It will automatically run the mf_extract.js code for the current 
package installed in your project.

You may also use `mf_extract -v` for more verbose output, showing the
current version, project dir, and each extracted string.

The full translation Web UI will be available at `/translate` in your app
(see [example](/translate), [security options](#security)).

Continue reading below for the full documentation on [templates](#templates),
[javascript](#javascript), [options](#options) and [translation](#translation).

<a name="fulldocs"></a>
## Full Docs

<a name="templates"></a>
### Handlebars Templates

```html
{{dstache}}mf 'keyname' 'keytext' VAR1=TemplateVar VAR2=etc}}
```

For longer MessageFormat Strings, you can do this:
```html
{{dstache}}#mf KEY='keyname' VAR1=TemplateVar VAR2=etc}}
    long keytext
{{dstache}}/#mf}
```

For real live examples, see the [examples](/examples) page.

Notes:

1. *TemplateVar*, etc, are *regular template variables or helper functions*.  Reactivity is maintained!  You can throw in a quoted value here for testing (e.g. VAR1='male')

2. *keytext* is potentially optional.  You could have all text compiled in advance (by hand, for now), and thus also reduce the size of your templates.  However, I made this available as an option since it's much easier to have text inline in your code and automatically extract it later; I feel this was what made the adoption of gettext so successful.  It also provides a useful fallback.

3. You can also optionally pass a `LOCALE=value` to control the translation of just a single block.

<a name="javascript"></a>
### Javascript (if needed)

```
mf(key, params, message, locale);
```

Notes:

1. *message* is optional (can be *null*), as per the above.
2. *locale* is optional, defaults to Session.get('locale') on the client (reactive);

<a name="translation"></a>
### Translation

We supply a tool to extact strings from templates and javascript, and early management for translations.  Inside your Meteor project directory:

```bash
sudo npm install -g meteor-messageformat
mf_extract
```

Run `mf_extract` every time you want to update the strings in your project.  Make sure
to always run it inside your project directory.  The program reads and writes
to `server/mfExtract.js` in the project root.

You may also use `mf_extract -v` for more verbose output, showing the
current version, project dir, and each extracted string.

Manage translations at `/translate` in your app (see [security options](#security)).

The `mfAll.js` (generated from the Web UI), may be freely moved between
your devel and production servers, as necessary.

On load, we'll always check that we are up to date (with both files), without deleting anything, and only replacing entries with newer timestamps.  When a string is updated
from `mfExtracts.js`, all it's translations are marked as fuzzy.

<a name="options"></a>
### Options

Options are specified at init time.  Note that the first argument to `mfPkg.init()`
is ALWAYS the native language of your app, e.g. 'en'.  Usage:

```js
mfPkg.init('en', {
	option1: value1,
	option2: value2,
	...
});
```

Available options:

<table class="docTable" id="tOptions">
	<tr>
		<th>Option</th>
		<th>Values</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>sendPolicy</td>
		<td>'current' (default) or 'all'</td>
		<td>Languages to send to client</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<a name="methods"></a>
### Methods

All methods below are in the `mfPkg` namespace:

<table class="docTable" id="tMethods">
	<tr>
		<th>Name</th>
		<th>Params</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>setLocale()</td>
		<td>'en', 'en_GB', etc.</td>
		<td>Ensures all strings for requested language
			are fully loaded, then changes Session locale</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>ready()</td>
		<td></td>
		<td>A reactive `ready()` function.  True when
			language data for current locale is fully
			loaded</td>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>updated()</td>
		<td></td>
		<td>A reactive method which is invalidated
			any time `ready()` changes from false
			to true (i.e. new language data is
			fully loaded).  Use this as a dependecy
			when using the `mf()` JavaScript method
			(together with `Session.get('locale')`)
			to ensure proper reactivity.</td>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>webUI.allow(),<br />
			webUI.deny()</td>
		<td>allow/deny function</td>
		<td>Defaults to any logged in user.<br />
			See note below on [security](#security)</td>
	</tr>
</table>

## Optimization

<a name="loadtime"></a>
### Load Time

When offering multiple languages to the client, you need to choose
between two trade offs:

1. Longer initial client load, instant language change (`sendPolicy: 'all'`)
2. Quicker initial client load, slower when changing to a new language for
the first time (`sendPolicy: 'current'`).  Switching back to a previously
loaded language is instant.

How this all works is discussed in [client sync](#clientsync).

To further optimize load time, you could only use keys in your templates
(and remove the native strings), but this isn't well supported yet.  TODO:
allow this in mf_extract, and potentially provide code to fill in missing
native strings (rather than just showing the key).

<a name="rendering"></a>
### Rendering

This section is only relevant for (`sendPolicy: 'current'`).  If the `'all'` policy
is used, you don't need to worry about this.

Every use of `{{dstache}}mf}}` is rerendered every time, EITHER:

1. Session `locale` is changed
2. We finish syncing new language data

To avoid all strings rerendering TWICE, you need to ensure that language data
is available before your template is rendered.  This is relevant in two
places:

**Initial page load** (for non-native language): If using iron-router, use
`waitOn: mfPkg` when defining your route (and ensure you have a `loadingTemplate`
set).

This will show your loading page until language data is ready to be displayed
(otherwise the user will first see the native strings, which will then be redrawn
in the requested language, when available).

If you have other things you need to waitOn, just create a function which returns
`mfPkg` as part of the array, e.g. `waitOn: function() { return [ mfPkg, Meteor.subscribe('something' ]; }`.

**Changing locale**: Call `mfPkg.setLocale()` rather than using `Session.set`
directly.  This will *first* load the necessary language data, and only *then*
change the locale.  You can also integrate some template logic (`based on
mfPkg.ready()`) to show a loader in the interim.

<a name="underhood"></a>
## Under the Hood

<a name="extraction"></a>
### Extraction

The `mf_extract` tool will recursively walk through your project (skipping symlinks),
looking for *&#42;.js* and *&#42;.html* files, and extracting the strings from any calls to
`mf()`, `{{dstache}}mf}}` and `{{dstache}}#mf}}`.

It writes a `server/mfExtract.js` in the root directory of your project,
where it notes the string, the file and line
number where it was found, and the name of the containing template or function
name.

Note, it doesn't only write to this file.  If the file already exists, it is
loaded first, and this is how we know if a string has been updated or removed
since the last run, and maintain a revision history.

You may also use `mf_extract -v` for more verbose output, showing the
current version, project dir, and each extracted string.

In the future, when Meteor [allows multiple source handlers](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/meteor-core/0QJa5EAXQhc/lJ71DqLipcQJ), this process will be handled
automatically when Meteor loads, without the need to run an external utility.

<a name="translationUH"></a>
### Translation

The `mfStrings` collection contains the info of all *current* strings in the project.
The `mfRevisions` collection contains the revision history of each string.
When a source/native string is updated, a new revision is added, and all translations
for that key are marked as **fuzzy** (just like machine translations).

Strings that are translations contain a `sourceId` field, which is the `revisionId`
of the source string it was translated against.  In the future, translators will
be able to see the diff of a source string for fuzzy translations, for convenience.

When starting up, your Meteor project will load both `mfExtracts.js` and
`mfAll.js`.  We look at the modification time (mtime) from the last update
of each file from our previous run, and then process every string which has
been updated since then, updating the database as necessary.

Note, the latter file contains all current strings (and most recent revision data,
TODO) in all languages, including their _id in the database.  During startup, we'll
ensure that we have the correct id's for each string, so that 1) revision validity
/ history works correctly, 2) you can save translations from an online demo app
back to your source before releasing updates, and 3) have a complete backup of all
your translations (although you should probably backup your database anyway).

<a name="clientsync"></a>
### Client Sync (what's sent over the wire)

Native strings are always sent to the client, since they are already compiled into
your templates.  This is both convenient for developers, and useful as a fallback
for clients, if a translation does not exist.

However, since `keytext` is optional, you could opt to omit it, and thus avoid
sending the native strings for users of other languages.  However, missing strings
will just show the `keyname` (TODO, logic to auto fill missing keys).

By default, translations are loaded *on demand* (`sendPolicy: 'current'` in
[options](#options)).  When a user changes languages,
translations are sent in a { key1: text1, key2: text2 } format using a Meteor method.
Updated keys for the current language are sent through a regular publish function.
Strings are cached; if the user changes back to a previous languages, strings will
not be sent over the wire again, except for strings that were updated since then.

If you want language changing to be instant (at the expense of a longer initial
load time - up to you), use the `sendPolicy: 'all`' [option](#option).
This loads all languages when the app is first loaded (see [Optimization: Load Time](#loadtime)).

Note: the strings themselves are not reactive.  Users will see updated strings
next time the string is rendered (i.e. a different template rendered for the
first time, or the current template rerendered because of some other reactive
variable.)  This is to avoid annoying and confusing the user with strings
changing before their eyes if people are working on translations.

See [Optimization: Rendering](#rendering) for info on the reactive `ready()` and
`updated()` methods which can be used to ensure your strings are not unecessarily
rendered when changing locales (when language data is loaded on demand).

In the future, offline collections will be supported (via e.g.
[offline-data](https://github.com/awwx/meteor-offline-data) or
[GroundedDB](https://github.com/GroundMeteor/Meteor-GroundDB)), and strings
will be cached offline on the client and only updated strings will be synced
on reconnect.

<a name="security"></a>
## Security

Be default, anyone can access the Web UI summary screen, and any logged in user
can add/update translations.  To fine tune this behaviour (both access to the webUI
and to the underlying mfStrings and mfRevisions collections), use `mfPkg.webUI.allow()`
and `mfPkg.webUI.deny()` calls, just like would you would in Meteor.

To recap, you can pass a boolean function as a parameter to these functions.  Access
will be granted if *at least one* allow() function returns true, and *all* 
deny() functions (if any) return false.

*On the client*, a tiny page will be shown on the client if access is denied.  Since
the functions are checked in an iron-router `before()` call, you can override this
behaviour in your functions thus:

```js
if (accessDenied && Meteor.isClient) {
	this.render('myCustomTemplate');
	this.stop();
}
```

*On the server*, the allow/deny functions are called just like their regular
counterparts for inset/update/remove.  The value of `this` and the applied
arguments are identical to Meteor, e.g. `userId`, `doc` and optionally (for
update), `fieldNames` and `modifier`.

Should it be necessary, you can individually
add your own allow/deny funcs to insert/update/remove to the `mfPkg.mfStrings` and
`mfPkg.mfRevisions` collections manually (our allow/deny calls are applied
uniformly to all of these).

Note, since our funcs are run on the client (iron-router before) and server (Collection allow/deny), you should ensure you use `Meteor.isClient` or `Meteor.isServer` where
appropriate.

<a name="whyusekeys"></a>
## Why use Keys?

It's true that *gettext* doesn't require us to name our strings with keys, and
has a smart algorithm to know if a string is a new string or an update to an
existing string, through a combination of string simularity (fuzzy matching)
and string location (file, approx. position)<sup>1</sup>.

This is very convenient for the programmer, but not fullproof.  It can occassionally
cause problems (mismatched and lost translations) which are better to be avoided.  Also, in
the case where we're sending all strings over the wire, we might prefer to optimize
our app, sending over smaller key names rather than all the complete strings (when
not using the native lang) -- although currently we don't recommend this yet (TODO).

Since `keyname` will always be shown when `keytext` is missing, you could potentially
choose to ignore the above advice and simply call `mf` with 1 argument, the string.
But if you change even a single character in this string, you'll lose every single
existing translation for that string, and translators won't have access to the revision
history for that string.  *You are strongly encouraged to make a little extra effort,
once off, to avoid a lot of unexpected frustration in the future*.

<span style="font-size: 70%"><sup>1</sup> As far as I know... sources for the
exact algorithm would be welcome.</span>

<a name="misc"></a>
## Misc

<a name="glossary"></a>
## Glossary

* **Internationalization (i18n)** - support for multiple languages (translation)
* **Localization (l10n)** - cultural support for e.g. dates, number formatting, etc.
* **Locale** - language and culture info, e.g. en_US is both US English and US formatting

<a name="roadmap"></a>
### Roadmap

1. ~~Extract all strings from templates to allow for translation~~ DONE (TODO, consider
precompilation options)

1. It would be nice if *keyname* could be unique *per template*, but currently [there is no way for a template helper to know the name of a calling template](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/658)

1. ~~Longer term: Allow additional languages to be loaded *as needed*, and reactively rerender all dependencies once it's available.~~ DONE

1. ~~Longest term: create a system to allow for string building and translation online (also in MessageFormat.js')~~ STARTED, early release, TODO - string builder wizard for
translators, with dropdown blocks and permutation previews

1. ~~Longest term~~: a centrally hosted website to handle translation for apps using the
smart package.

<a name="differences"></a>
### Differences to the original MessageFormat.js by Alex Sexton

1. The original package requires all language strings to be defined externally (optionally in a per-directory basis).  I prefered the option to define them inline and have a tool to extract them for precompilation (see note about this, above).

2. The above naming structure is another reason why I don't currently allow for the existing precompilation code to be used.  In a Meteor style project, it makes more sense to use the Template names as part of the hierarchy.

2. It's unclear whether the original package, once it adds multi-language support, will allow multiple languages to be loaded in memory simultaneously.
